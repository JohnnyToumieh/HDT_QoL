# Welcome to HDT QoL!

This plugin was supposed to be a neat addition to HDT's Battlegrounds section, integrating into their well made overlays.
However, their APIs currently barely support Battlegrounds. This plugin will hence only have the below feature:
- Show which tribe is banned (even during hero selection)

Unfortunetly, I wasn't able to add the below features in a plugin:
- Show average damage in bob's buddy
- Show median damage in bob's buddy

If you want to have access to these features and want a neater looking interface, you can always download my modified HDT that I will keep updated:
