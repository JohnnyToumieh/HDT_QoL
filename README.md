# Welcome to HDT QoL!

This plugin was supposed to be a neat addition to HDT's Battlegrounds section, integrating into their well made overlays.
However, their APIs currently barely support Battlegrounds. This plugin will hence only have the below feature:
- Show which tribe is banned (even during hero selection)

Unfortunetly, I wasn't able to add the below features in a plugin:
- Show average damage in bob's buddy
- Show median damage in bob's buddy

If you want to have access to these features and want a neater looking interface, you can always download my modified HDT that I will keep updated:

3.  Make sure you remove any old versions of HDT_QoL directory in the plugins directory of Hearthstone Deck Tracker completely, before upgrading versions.
4.  Unzip the archive to  `%AppData%/HearthstoneDeckTracker/Plugins`  To find this directory, you can click the following button in the Hearthstone Deck Tracker options menu:  `Options -> Tracker -> Plugins -> Plugins Folder`
5.  If you've done it correctly, HDT_QoL directory should be inside the Plugins directory. Inside the directory, should be a bunch of files, including a file called HDT_QoL.dll.
6.  Launch Hearthstone Deck Tracker. Enable the plugin in  `Options -> Tracker -> Plugins`.

## Settings

You can use the plugin's settings to:
- Disable the Banned Tribe Overlay
- Reposition the Banned Tribe Overlay

# Credits
With limited knowledge of C# and coding a plugin, I had to rely on checking out other plugins to take inspiration.
Here are some of these plugins:

- [Graveyard](https://github.com/RedHatter/Graveyard) by [RedHatter](https://github.com/RedHatter)
- [DrawPool](https://github.com/VeXHarbinger/DrawPool) by [VeXHarbinger](https://github.com/VeXHarbinger)
